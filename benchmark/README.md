Ghostferry benchmark setup
==========================

A benchmark "library" is provided with `./ghostferry_benchmark.rb`. An example
benchmark case can be seen with `./studies/batch_size.rb` and the post
processing is provided in `./studies/batch_size_vs_row_size.ipynb`. 

Some modifications are needed to make this benchmark work for other studies.
